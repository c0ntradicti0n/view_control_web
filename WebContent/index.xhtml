        <h1>Everything makes a difference</h1>
            <p>
            Welcome to the platform of hair-splitters and nitpickers in science.
            This is the protopye how possibly to use artificial intelligence to collect and combine distinctions in science and
            everywhere to think more accurate.
            </p>

            <p>
            One broad thesis about the following is this: One cannot write scientific papers without distinguishing.
            Explaining distinctions means, that one offers criteria to the reader, how to identify the things, that is to be talked about.
            As explained in the following, distinguishing is the main basis of acknowledgement or dismissing of truh of premisses.
            There is mainly one other kind of speech acts of the same epistemic category: saying what is equal.
            If you don't distinguish in a scientific paper and say only , what is equal and similar for you, one looses
            all the opportunities to decide, what are you talking about.
            </p>

        <p>
            The goal is to make an to make smart alecks from us all, that uses the collected distinctions to make inferences by
            <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/">non-monotonic logic</a>.
            Non-monotonic logic means to break with some inferences.
            Normal formal logic assumes, that premises are definitively clear and true.

        </p>
        <div class="example center">
            <p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> All informative things are useful.<br/>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
                    <strong>Premise 2:</strong> Some websites are not useful.</span> <br/>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> ∴ Some websites are not informative. </p>

            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism#Baroco_(AOO-2)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism#Baroco_(AOO-2)</a>  )      </div>

        <p>
            As the most people know, there may be some information on websites, that won't ever be useful for you.
            So the conclusion that was proposed on wikipedia may be forbidden. Every website is informative in some
            way, even if it's not useful in any way, neither for you nor others. (Asides, what about
            <a href="https://pr0gramm.com">https://pr0gramm.com</a>?)
            The formal side of this argument may be correct, but not the more important part of the truth of the
            premises, that comes into play, if the more non-monotonic logical nature of thinking forbids the
            conclusions, that the logician is about to make.
            So we try to help you, to check everytime if your premises are true or false. But first all the distinctions
            that we make must go onto the table.
        </p>

       This is because, not to make wrong inferences means in the first point to distinguish. To make it easy,
        if I tell you, Tux is a bird. So you may think, it can fly. But it's going to change your mind about, if this is added:
        Tux is a bird, but also a penguin is a bird! Did you forgot about this? So Tux, as linux people know, is a
        penguin.

        </p>
    <img src="resources/images/tux.jpeg" alt="Tux is of course a bird as you see. No feathers, can't fly."  class="center lg_img_button"></img>

    <p><a href="reader.xhtml">To collect such information there was build a tool to mark certain text passages with
        the parts of distinctions.</a>
        Two concepts: Bird and penguin, they are called "subjects" and there are explanations like: "has feathers" and
        "has no feathers".
        There is a semantically sensitive AI build with <a href="https://allennlp.org/elmo">AllenNLP</a>  to help you marking these things.
        It learns and marks itself. You can delete it's marks, correct them and make new ones. To do this, select some text
        and press the

        If you want to have flight around to calm down and take the auto pilot video, that makes a guided tour through
        semantically ordered space, where you can see the semantically compared annotations, that have been made by all
        contributors.
